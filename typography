Creating so-called Style Guide
This is a document referring to styles that i'll be using throughout the website. In many websites, i'll be using Headline, 
B-Headline, Navigation Text, Body Text and Byline Text. Creating this Guide will help me avoid inconsistencies.

Typography is both verbal and visual.

Classification of fonts:
- serif - with horizontal strokes in letters
- sans-serif - letters without those strokes
- script - simulates handwriting, good if i want a human element added to the page, but not good for body text.

NO COMIC SANS! EVER. :)

When mixing two faces (e.g. Head and B-Head), there are a few rules:
- don't mix two fonts from the same style, e.g. two humanist serifs
- don't choose two fonts from the same class, e.g. two serifs
- when combining fonts, try to find fonts that have a similar trait, but are otherwise different
- RULE OF THUMB: keep it the same or change it a lot
e.g. script font for head face and geometric font for body text

beginners hint - using one font family will be good - we can be sure that they complement each other

Use web-licensed fonts!
